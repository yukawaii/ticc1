# Hangman
Try to guess 5 random words in a row, one letter at a time! Players have 7 incorrect guesses before a word is missed, although only guessed letters count (numbers or other unrelated keystrokes are ignored). If a player can guess at least 3 words, they win a trophy for the round.

Since most mobile devices don't have keyboards, an optional on-screen keyboard is provided so you can play Hangman anywhere!
