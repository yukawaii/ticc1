## How does it work?

### Gameplay

The user can press any key or click/touch anywhere to start the game.

A word ("up", "left", "down" or "right") will appear on the screen. You'll have less than two seconds to press the corresponding arrow key on your keyboard (or, for mobile users, you can use the on-screen keyboard).

If you choose the correct key, the next word will pop up once time has expired. As time goes on, you'll see additional directions and multipliers. For example, if you see "left x2", that means you'll need to press the left arrow key twice. You'll have less time for each set of directions as the game progresses, so be fast!

When you make a mistake, the game will end. You'll see how long you lasted, as well as your score. To reload the game, simply press or click anywhere.

### Highlights

* A clean, responsive design using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript
