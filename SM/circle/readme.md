Circle the Cat
========

Circle the Cat is an experiment with the canvas HTML5 element.  It is a javascript recreation of the [Circle the Cat](http://members.shaw.ca/gf3/circle-the-cat.html) Flash game.

The goal is to encircle the cat, without letting it get out.  Click on the light blue dots to try to trap it with dark blue dots.
